To keep the detection system up-to-date with evolving threats, the model can be retrained by collecting new malicious and legitimate URLs from trusted sources like PhishTank or Alexa. These new entries are combined with the existing dataset, and the model is retrained using the updated data. This helps the system learn new attack patterns.
